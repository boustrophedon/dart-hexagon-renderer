This is going to be a testbed for various rendering techniques. The first thing I did was write code to draw a hexagon(al prism) and camera code for fps-style movement. Next I'll probably try to implement some shading because currently the colors are set manually.

"feature list"
- renders hexagons via an add_hexagon method
- fps-style camera


todo:
- more kinds of cameras, though it's not that hard to do
- shading
	lots of different things to try out here
- I'm explicitly not trying to make a game, but maybe add something like billboarded sprites
- hidden surface removal (don't draw hexagons that can't possibly be visible) and associated data structures
